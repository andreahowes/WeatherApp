# OAuth2

This is a working implementation of spring boot security oauth2. This differs from the first implementation of oAuth2 in that this implementation uses a mySQL database instead of an in memory database. 


## Getting Started

You can get started utilizing this example by cloning the project to your local machine:
```
$ git clone https://github.com/ashcreek/Oauth2Security.git
```
Then use the .sql files in the database package to create the database.

### Prerequisites

In order to execute this program you will need to install the following:
* Java JDK
* MySQL
* Gradle

## Postman Entries
